## 🛠️ Technology & Architecture

The project is built entirely with **Kotlin** and adheres to modern Android development best practices.

* **Language:** **Kotlin**
* **User Interface (UI):** **Jetpack Compose** - For building a declarative UI that is concise and easy to manage.
* **Architecture:** **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** - Separates UI logic from business logic, making the codebase easier to maintain and test.
* **State Management:** **Kotlin Coroutines** & **StateFlow** - For handling asynchronous tasks and managing UI state efficiently.
* **Dependency Injection:** **Hilt** - Simplifies the management and provision of dependencies within the application.
* **Navigation:** **Navigation Component** - Manages the flow between different screens.
* **Mapping & Location:**
    * **Google Maps Compose Library:** Integrates Google Maps into the Compose UI.
    * **Google Play Services Location:** Fetches the user's current location.
* **Image Loading:** **Coil** - A modern and efficient image loading library for Kotlin.
